# Security Fix: Customer Email Address Exposure

## Issue Resolved ✅

**Problem**: The feedback table had a public SELECT policy that allowed anyone to access approved testimonials, including sensitive customer email addresses and other personal information.

**Severity**: ERROR - Critical security vulnerability allowing email harvesting for spam/phishing attacks.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Dangerous Public Access Policy
- Dropped the "Everyone can view approved feedback" policy that exposed sensitive data
- This policy previously allowed unrestricted public access to customer emails

### 2. Created Secure Public Access Function
- Implemented `get_public_testimonials()` security definer function
- Only exposes safe, non-sensitive fields:
  - Testimonial content
  - Rating
  - Client name (not email)
  - Company name
  - Creation date
  - Featured status
- **Excludes sensitive data**: email addresses, client IDs, project IDs

### 3. Current Secure RLS Policies
The feedback table now has properly restricted access:

**✅ Admins can manage feedback** (ALL operations)
- Only admin users can view all feedback data including sensitive fields

**✅ Anyone can submit feedback** (INSERT only)
- Public can still submit new feedback

**✅ Users can view their own feedback** (SELECT for authenticated users)
- Clients can only see their own feedback submissions in the portal

### 4. Public Access Method
- Homepage and public testimonial displays must use `getPublicTestimonials()` from `/src/lib/testimonials.ts`
- This function safely calls the secure `get_public_testimonials()` database function
- No sensitive customer data is exposed to unauthorized users

## Security Verification ✅

- **Critical vulnerability eliminated**: Public cannot access customer emails
- **Functionality preserved**: Approved testimonials still displayable on homepage
- **Admin access maintained**: Admins can still manage all feedback data
- **Client access preserved**: Clients can still submit and view their own feedback

## Remaining Security Note

The only remaining security linter warning is about leaked password protection being disabled, which is a Supabase configuration setting unrelated to this data exposure issue.

## Files Updated

- Database: Removed dangerous RLS policy and created secure function
- `/src/lib/testimonials.ts`: Already implemented secure public access (no changes needed)
- All existing functionality preserved through secure access patterns

The customer email exposure vulnerability has been completely resolved while maintaining all existing application functionality.
