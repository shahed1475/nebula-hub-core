# Security Fix Report: Customer Email Exposure

## Issue Identified
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Type:** Data Exposure  
**Description:** The `feedback` table had a public RLS policy that allowed anyone to read approved feedback records, including sensitive customer email addresses.

## Security Vulnerability Details
- **Table Affected:** `public.feedback`  
- **Exposed Data:** Customer email addresses, client IDs, project IDs
- **Attack Vector:** Anyone could query the feedback table to harvest email addresses for spam/phishing
- **Policy:** "Everyone can view approved feedback" allowed unrestricted SELECT access

## Fix Implemented

### 1. Removed Dangerous Policy
```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Everyone can view approved feedback" ON public.feedback;
```

### 2. Created Secure Access Function
- Implemented `get_public_testimonials()` security definer function
- Only exposes non-sensitive fields: testimonial text, rating, client name, company name
- **Excludes:** email addresses, client IDs, project IDs, and other sensitive data

### 3. Added Helper Library
- Created `src/lib/testimonials.ts` with secure access functions
- Provides `getPublicTestimonials()` and `getFeaturedTestimonials()` functions
- Future-proofs public testimonial display

## Security Improvements
✅ **Customer emails no longer exposed** to public queries  
✅ **Principle of least privilege** applied - only necessary data exposed  
✅ **Security definer function** ensures controlled access  
✅ **Backwards compatibility** maintained for admin/client portal access

## Current Access Patterns
- **Admins:** Full access to all feedback data (unchanged)
- **Clients:** Can view their own feedback (unchanged)  
- **Public:** Can only access approved testimonials without sensitive data (new secure method)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Verify admin panel testimonial management still works
2. Verify client portal feedback submission/viewing still works  
3. Confirm public queries cannot access email addresses
4. Test the new `getPublicTestimonials()` function if implementing public testimonial display

## No Breaking Changes
This fix maintains all existing functionality while securing sensitive data. No frontend changes were required as no public-facing components currently display testimonials.
